title: You have no moral obligation to be offended about anything.
---

From my friend [T.K. Coleman's](http://tkcoleman.com/2019/04/10/on-being-offended/) blog today:

<blockquote><p>You have no moral obligation to be offended about anything.</p>

<p>Emotions ≠ Ethics</p>

<p>Moods ≠ Morality</p>

<p>Indignation ≠ Integrity</p>

<p>Your contribution to society is about what you do, not how you claim to feel.</p>

<p>You have the RIGHT to feel whatever YOU wish, but beware the machinations of those who claim you have the RESPONSIBILITY to feel whatever THEY wish.</p></blockquote>
