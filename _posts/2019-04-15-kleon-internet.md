title: Kleon says you are what you say you are

The internet: a tool for self invention. You can be a writer now. No degree required. Just write. As [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2007/02/19/time-travel-in-a-domestic-car/) wrote in 2007:

<blockquote><p>I love how on the internet... If somebody sees your poems, you’re a poet.  If somebody sees your comics, you’re a cartoonist.</p>

<p>I am whatever you say I am.</p></blockquote>
