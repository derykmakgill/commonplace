title: Why author Neil Gaiman didn't go to college
---

[Neil Gaiman's commencement speech](https://youtu.be/plWexCID-kA) is required watching. His awesome remarks on college are just a bonus for me. Want to be a writer? Write.

>I never graduated from university. I never even started at one. I escaped from school as soon as I could when the prospect of 4 more years of enforced learning before I could become the writer I wanted to be seemed stifling.
