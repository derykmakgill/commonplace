Ayn Rand is, once again, right. 

>A genius is a genius, regardless of the number of morons who belong to the same race - and a moron is a moron, regardless of the number of geniuses who share his racial origin.

<cite>Ayn Rand, The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism</cite>

Racial supremacism is an attempt to grant oneself the unearned.
