title: Horace, Socrates and Emerson on travel delusions
---

<blockquote><p>Traveling is a fool’s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.</p></blockquote> 

<cite>Emerson, Self-Reliance</cite><br><br>

From the Roman poet, Horace:

<blockquote><p>Quid terras alio calentes/ Sole mutamus?  patriae quis exsul / Se quoque fugit?</p>

<p>Why do we seek climates warmed by another sun?  Who is the man that by fleeing from his country, can also flee from himself?</p></blockquote>
<cite>Horace, Od., ii. 16, 18.</cite><br><br>

From Socrates, told by Montaigne in his essay *[On Solitude:](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3600/3600-h/3600-h.htm#link2HCH0038)*

<blockquote><p>One telling Socrates that such a one was nothing improved by his travels: “I very well believe it,” said he, “for he took himself along with him.</p></blockquote>
