title: Leonard E. Read on the central planners
---

Leonard E. Reads private papers at the Foundation for Economic Education are a "lost" treasure. 

A selection from an article I read today that was buried in his journal from 1958:

<blockquote><p>For the student of economics, this poses an interesting question: Can there
be a sensible, rational economic system for the wise, for those,'who know they
do not know much?</p>

<p>Certainly, such a system would bear no resemblance to the one devised bythdSe
who are at the other end of the intellectual spectrum -- the egotists, the
ones who are unaware of how little they know.</p>

<p>The egotists appear to beat the root of our social troubles for they are the
ones who see no difficult:i.es at all in arranging the lives of everyone in
accord with their own de~ign. Indeed, they'are so profoundly impressed with
their prowess in this respect that they favor using the police force to
implement their schemes for the improvement of society.</p></blockquote>
