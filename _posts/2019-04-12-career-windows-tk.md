Great career advice from my friend [T.K. Coleman:](https://twitter.com/TK_Coleman/status/1109636184232333312)

<blockquote><p>Think about your career in terms of “Windows of opportunity.”</p>

<p>What’s hot right now might not be hot in the future. Today’s connections may be no good tomorrow. The people/practices that were good enough to get you where you are might not be sufficient to sustain you later.</p></blockquote>

<cite>T.K. Coleman</cite>

So many things I did when I was 19 and 20 no longer excite me. But I'm so glad I did them because they were necessary steps to figure out what excites me now.

Don't miss your chance. You might not have the same passion in a few years.
