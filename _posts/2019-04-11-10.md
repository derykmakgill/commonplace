Find of the day. Leonard E. Read takes down the central planners once again...

**September 29.**

>When all the verbiage is cut through and all the shouting dies down, what really is it FEE argues for? Just this: You preposterous egotists! Get the hell off the backs of folks who know as much as you but who know they don't know much. Leave us with ourselves
and our Creator. The Creator, not you, is our source of creative action. Sure, all of us will organize to protect this creative relationship but, other than this, get gone! Leave the creative relationship be, you wou1dbe gods! We are no less fallible than you but you are dizzy.
