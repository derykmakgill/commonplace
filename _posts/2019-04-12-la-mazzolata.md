A brilliant chapter from *The Count of Monte Cristo,* on the evil of wishing misfortune upon others to help us bear our own. Don't pretend you haven't done it before.

<blockquote><p>'A pardon for Peppino!' yelled Andrea, entirely roused from the state of torpor into which he had seemed to be plunged. 'Why a pardon for him and not for me? We were to die together. I was promised that he would die before me. You have no right to make me die alone. I don't want to die alone!' And he broke away from the two priests, twisting, shouting, bellowing, and making insane efforts to break the ropes binding his hands.</p>

<p>The executioner made a sign to his two assistants, who jumped off the scaffold and seized the prisoner.</p>

<p>'Whats wrong?' Franz asked the count.</p>

<p>'What is wrong?' the count repeated. 'Don't you understand?' What's wrong is that this human being who is about to die is furious because his fellow creature is not dying with him and, if he were allowed to do so, he would tear him apart with his nails and his teeth rather than leave him to enjoy the life of which he himself is about to be deprived. Oh men! Race of crocodiles, as Karl Moor says,' the count exclaimed, brandishing two clenched fists towards the heads of the crowd. 'How well I know you by your deeds and how invariably you succeed in living down to what one expects of you!'</p>

<p>Andrew and the two assistant executioners were rolling around in the dust, the prisoner still crying out: 'He must die, I want him to die! You do not have the right to kill me alone!'</p>

<p>'Look, look,' the count continued, grasping each of the two young men by the hand. 'Look, because I swear to you, this is worthy of your curiosity. Here is a man who was resigned to his fate, who was walking to the scaffold and about to die without resisting and without recriminations. Do you know what consoled him? Do you know what resigned him to his fate? It was the fact that another man would share his anguish, that another man was to die like him, that another man was to die before him! Put two sheep in the slaughter-house or two oxen in the abattoir and let one of them realize that his companion will not die, and the sheep will bleat with joy, the ox low with pleasure. But man, man whom God made in His image, man to whom God gave his first, this sole, this supreme law, that he should love his neighbor, man to whom God gave a voic to express his thoughtsâ€”what is man's first cry when he learns that his neighbor is saved? A curse. All honour to man, the masterpiece of nature, the lord of creation!'</p>

<p>He burst out laughing, but such a terrible laugh that one realized he must have suffered horribly to be able to laugh in such a way.</p></blockquote>
