title: Gaiman on writing

Hereâ€™s writer Neil Gaiman on the Tim Ferriss podcast:

> Part of what I discovered, particularly about being a novelist, is writing a novel works best if you can do the same day over and over again. The closer you can come to Groundhog Day, you just repeat that day. You set up a day that works for yourself.

<cite>Neil Gaiman</cite>
