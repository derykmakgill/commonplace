title: Leonard Read on wise ignorance
---

"I don't know" is sometimes the wisest thing you can say.

Leonard Read seemed to agree. From his journals:

>At one end of the intellectual spectrum are the wise, those who know they don't know much; and on the other end are the egotists, those who have little, if any, awareness of how little they know.

<cite>Leonard Read Journals, September 6, 1959</cite>

Socrates said it a couple thousand years before though:

Although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I know.

<cite>The Apology, Benjamin Jowett translation</cite>
