title: The Sick Resume
---

Maybe this doesn't belong here in my commonplace book because it's not lofty enough, but it is *my* book after all, and I love rewriting poems.

From my friends at [Crash:](https://twitter.com/CareerCrash/status/1111044496597372928)

*O Resume, thou art sick.*

*The job seeker*

*That discovers an opportunity*

*By using something better*

*Has found out thy lies*

*Of 12-point Roman font*

*And the proof of their work*

*Does thy life destroy.*
