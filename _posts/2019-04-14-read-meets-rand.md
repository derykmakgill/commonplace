title: Leonard Read meets Ayn Rand
---

Here are Leonard Read's funny [diary remarks](https://history.fee.org/leonard-read-journal/1951/leonard-e-read-journal-november-1951/) on meeting with Ayn Rand in 1951. 

I discovered these while working through the journals to add quotes to [Read's WikiQuotes page.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonard_E._Read)
